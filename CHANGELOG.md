## 1.4.2
### Bugfixes
- Drag Ruler now works again on gridless maps

## 1.4.1
### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where Drag Ruler wouldn't work at all on hex grids when the Hex Token Size Support isn't installed

### Translation
- Added chinese translation (thanks to zeteticl)


## 1.4.0
### New features
- If the [Terrain Ruler module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/terrain-ruler/) is installed and activated, Drag Ruler will now take difficult terrain that was placed with the [TerrainLayer module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/TerrainLayer/) into account.
- The ruler will now always be drawn from the tokens center (even for tokens larger than 1x1) on all grid types (on Hex Grids this requires the Hex Token Size Support module).
- For tokens larger than 1x1 the highlighted path will now reflect the tokens size (on Hex Grids this requires the Hex Token Size Support module)
- The GM's Drag Ruler can now be hidden from non GM players via a setting.
- When multiple different colors apply to a single grid space because the path crosses itself the color representing ranges further away will take priortiy over colors representing closer ranges.

### API
- Speed providers can now selectively ignore difficult terrain and even implement their own cost functions, if the default Drag Ruler behavior doesn't fit the game system. This can be achieved by overriding the new, optional `SpeedProvider` function `getCostForStep`.


## 1.3.5
### Bugfixes
- Fixed a regression where spaces could suddenly change their color during measurement


## 1.3.4
### Module compatibility
- Increased compatiblility with other modules (namely Drag Ruler and Terrain Ruler are no longer incompatible)

## 1.3.3
### Bugfixes
- Speed Provider Settings are now being saved for non GM players


## 1.3.2
### Translation
- Updated japanese translation (thanks to togue)


## 1.3.1
### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the coloring of ranges wouldn't work with the generic speed provider if the Dash Multiplier was set to 0


## 1.3.0
### New features
- The color used to indicate speed ranges is now configurable
- The settings dialog has been reworked

### System compatibility
- Drag Ruler's Generic SpeedProvider is now aware of good default values for the lancer game system (thanks to Grygon)

### API changes
This release introduces a new API that is incompatible with the old API. The new API offers more flexibility for users and Speed Providers alike and allows to add new features in the future without breaking compatibility again. The old API will continue to function, but to profit from any of the features below Speed Providers need to switch to the new API. For more details check out the API documentation.

The following things have changed with the new API:
- Colors used by speed providers can now be changed by the user via configuration
- Speed Providers can now offer settings to the user that will be integrated into Drag Ruler's settings menu
- Speed Providers can now conditionally disable Drag Ruler for some tokens


## 1.2.2
### Translation
- Added japanese translation (thanks to touge)

## 1.2.1

- Drag Ruler is now compatible with Hex Token Size Support. For compatibility Hex Token Size Support Version 0.5.4 or higher is required. Thanks to Ourobor for helping making this possible.

## 1.2.0
### New features
- Right click and spacebar can now be swapped, allowing to place waypoints with right click and removing them with spacebar
- The module can now be configured use a fixed color instead of the player color for the first speed range
- On gridless maps the ruler will now change it's color to indicate the different speed ranges
- As an alternative to right click (or spacebar, if you have swapped right and spacebar behavior) waypoints can now also be deleted with the `X` key

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where tokens wouldn't be moved to the corect end position on gridless maps
